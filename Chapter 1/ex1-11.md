***Exercise 1-11***. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

1. It tests 1 character lines after one space like so:

    @ % 3 @ %
    a b c d e
    1 2 3 4 5
    
2. Given No. 1's examples, it does not only counts letters, it also counts other ASCII characters
like symbols ( !@#$%^&*() ) and numbers. ( 1234567890 )
